# Coronavirus React Project

The aim of this project is to merge the Coronavirus board game made by HomemadeLab Games into React.

The goal is to ultimately bring all of the advances made in this project to the current game without any noticeable changes in the front-end. We will transition to using our own web hosting service and discontinue using github.io for hosting.

## Access

The project is currently accesible on the following website:
